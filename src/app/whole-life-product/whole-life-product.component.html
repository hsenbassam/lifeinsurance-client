    <p>Whole life insurance is a type of permanent life insurance coverage designed to last from the time you purchase your
      policy through the remainder of your life.</p>
    <p>It typically offers guaranteed acceptance and builds cash value over time.</p>
    <p>This kind of insurance, like term insurance, will pay your beneficiaries a specific amount of money upon your death.
      The primary difference between term and whole life is that term insurance provides coverage for a set period (10 or
      20 years, for instance), while whole life insurance pays its benefit as long as premiums have been paid.</p>
